 Welcome!! Welcome to Optim.Lab at the Department of Statistics, 
  University of Seoul. Our research laboratory focuses on developing machine learning models, 
  including various applications of neural networks, and studying optimization methodologies for fitting these models.
  Currently, our lab mainly deals with image, network, weather, ranking, and stock market data. 
  We work on tasks such as feature vector extraction, probability structure estimation, and the development of classification and regression models within these data domains.
  You can explore the research papers produced by our lab through the following <a href="https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=A-E3uEMAAAAJ&hl=ko">Google Scholar</a> page.
